#IoT based Weather Station

The equipment required for this project are:

    Arduino
    DHT11 Sensor
    LCD Display
    ESP32 Module
    Breadboard
    Jumper Wires
    10k OHM Potentiometer
    Resistor
    tactile button
    USB A-B cable
#Jupyter Notebook:

  Provides an predictive analysis of islamabad's weather data by checking correlation between different factors affecting weather and using different ML models.
# User-Instruction
After all of the wiring, plug your power bank to the Arduino.

Your LCD display and DHT11 should start up. Press the tact button and your LCD backlight should light up.

Now you have a portable temperature and humidity sensor with a real time display.
